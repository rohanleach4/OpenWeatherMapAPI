# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

### `yarn test`

### `yarn build`

## Weather App

# This weather app is built on create-reat-app

## due to time, this bear bones app was constructed thus:

### I used my kickstart CSS library

https://github.com/rohanleach4/kickstart-css

### It references a typescript compendium of best pracitces, which I forked from andredesousa

https://github.com/rohanleach4/typescript-best-practices

### For _fun_ it references Axios rather than HTML5 Fetch

### To speed delivery with Typescript, I used VS Code to reference Typing errors
